## Learning Objectives

In this class, we will follow the design thinking process throughout the course, providing lessons on user research, wireframing, low/high-fidelity prototyping, usability testing, and setting up a portfolio. Each student will be given a case study at the beginning of the course to apply the process practically and to enhance the UI/UX of a digital mobile platform. 

**Week 1** will follow a lecture and workshop format, surveying the design process and giving students the skills necessary to tackle their case studies.

**Week 2** will be structured around work sessions and individual feedback/crits and will also include talks by industry professionals. At the end of this week, each student will present their completed case study to the class and finish documenting it so that it is suitable for inclusion in a design portfolio.

Topics covered will include:
- Design thinking and process
- Figma fundamentals
- Lo-fi paper prototyping
- Hi-fi digital prototyping
- User testing
- Presenting a case study and narrative

## Grading

Students will be given credit and assigned grades based on their class participation throughout the course and their final presentations for their case study

<!-- This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] – the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
